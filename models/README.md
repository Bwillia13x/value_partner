# Research & Models

Notebooks, scripts, and experiment artifacts live here.

Suggested structure:

* `notebooks/` – exploratory research and prototyping.
* `src/` – reusable Python modules (factor library, feature engineering, model training code).
* `experiments/` – MLflow runs, hyperparameter tuning configs.

An `MLproject` file and a local MLflow server will be introduced in a later milestone.
