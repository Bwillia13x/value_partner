# Model Governance Documentation

This folder captures the governance artifacts required by the Model Governance Framework (MGF).

Contents:
1. `MDLC_TEMPLATE.md` – canonical template to document each model's lifecycle.
2. `model_inventory.csv` – master inventory file containing one row per model.

All models must have a completed MDLC document and a corresponding inventory entry _before_ deployment to production.
