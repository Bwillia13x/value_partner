# Microservices Layer

This folder contains API and worker code that exposes models and data to internal and external consumers.

Phase-1 goals:

* Build a minimal FastAPI service with a health endpoint.
* Containerize with Docker and deploy via CI/CD.
* Add authentication middleware and rate-limiting in future phases.
